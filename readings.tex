\paragraph{Lectures 20--23} My treatment of hypothesis testing is somewhat different from what's in the book, but there is some overlap: the relevant sections are 9-1, 9-2, Appendix to 9-2, 9-3, 9-4, 9-5, and 9-6
\paragraph{Lectures 24--25} 
In our final two lectures, we'll revisit linear regression using the new tools we've learned since Lecture 4. 
Make sure to review the material from Lecture 4 before coming to Lecture 24. 
As with hypothesis testing, my treatment of this material diverges somewhat from the book, but the relevent sections are 12-1, 12-2, 13-1, 13-2, 13-3, 13-4, and 14-1. 
In section 12.2, don't worry too much about the formula for the standard error since I won't ever ask you to calculate this by hand (we'll use R). 
I just want you to understand the basic intuition about why and how the regression slope has a sampling distribution.
Similarly, don't worry about Equations 13-4 through 13-8 in section 13.2. 
We'll always use R to carry out the calculations.
