\frametitle{Some Notes on Clickers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item There was a last-minute change in the model of clicker sold at the bookstore: they now carry only the QT. Either the QT or NXT will work for this class. For more information, see
\url{http://www.sas.upenn.edu/computing/instructional/clickers}
	\item A clicker registration tool has been added to Canvas under ``Modules.'' Click on it and follow the instructions. 
	\item Any votes you make before registering your clicker \emph{will still be stored}. Registering simply links your name to the unique clicker id number on the back of your remote. \alert{Just make sure to register before the drop deadline to make sure I can award you credit.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Collect some data to analyze later in the semester.
	\item None of the questions are sensitive and your name will not be linked to your responses. I will post an anonymized version of the dataset on my website.
	\item Participation is  \emph{strictly voluntary}. You can still earn full clicker credit for today's lecture without participating in the survey.
