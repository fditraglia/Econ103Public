\begin{quote}
Social scientists have studied the issue for decades, but the seemingly simple question “Does race affect sentencing?” is surprisingly difficult to answer on the basis of empirical evidence.

Abrams explains: \alert{``The most straightforward way you might look at it is to say, Let’s look at what sentences people get and see whether sentence length varies by race. If it looks like people of one race receive longer sentences than another, that might indicate that the criminal justice system is unfair. But the shortcoming to that approach is that it’s also possible that sentences can differ for many reasons; for example, it’s possible people of different races might have different criminal histories on average, and that could also explain the difference in sentence length''}

To address that difficulty [confounders] social scientists have ... applied control variables to standard regression equations, a statistical method for identifying significant correlations between observed events. For instance, controlling for type of crime committed or for the defendant’s criminal history, researchers look to see whether the results of their equation still show racial disparity.\alert{``The problem with that is you still leave the possibility that any differences you see are due to unobserved variables, differences that might be there but that you can't control for''} Abrams says.``That might be demeanor in the courtroom, it might be the quality of the attorney you can afford, it might be some details about the crime that you might not capture in your data. If those things are correlated with race, which they probably are, you’re not going to know whether the effect you think you’re detecting is really race or is something else''
