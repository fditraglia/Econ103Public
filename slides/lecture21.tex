Lower p-value means stronger evidence. 
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Two Equivalent Definitions of P-value}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Smallest significance level at which our observed test statistic would cause us to reject $H_0$.
		\item The probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one actually observed if $H_0$ were true.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{block}


\begin{block}{(Two-sided p-value) $= 2 \; \times$  (one-sided p-value)}
Reject $H_0$ based on two-sided test $\implies$ Reject $H_0$ based on appropriate one-sided test. The converse is \emph{false}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Specify Null and Alternative Hypotheses
\item Identify a Test Statistic: a function of the data and the unknown parameter that has a known sampling distribution under the null.
\item Specify a Decision Rule and a Critical Value so the Type I Error Rate equals $\alpha$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{alertblock}{Alternative to Step 3}
	Calculate P-Value: the minimum significance level  ($\alpha$) at which we would reject $H_0$ given the observed data.

\alert{You already know lots of sampling distributions! Testing is very similar to constructing confidence intervals in that the steps are always the same, and the only thing that differs is \emph{which} sampling distribution we work with. We'll look at more examples next time.}
